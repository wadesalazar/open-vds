This is a binary distribution of ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.

Python:
Install the python wheel like so:
python3 -m pip install openvds-[version_dependent].whl

Now its possible to start python3 and do
>>> import openvds
Please look in share/openvds/examples/SliceServer for an example of how to use the Python API.

Linux:
The shared objects are installed into the lib folder, and the tools
into the bin folder. To quickly test out ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} add the lib
folder to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable and test the commands. For example if current working directory is in the bin folder:

$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../lib ./SEGYImport

to execute the SEGYImport command.


To build the examples create a build folder inside share/openvds/examples and run cmake. For example:

$ mkdir share/openvds/examples/build
$ cd share/openvds/examples/build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$ cmake --build .

Then you can run the getting started example by doing:
$ ./GettingStarted/getting-started

Windows:
The dll files are installed in the bin folder together with the tools.

To compile the examples use the "Open Folder" functionality in Visual Studio
and open the share/openvds/examples folder. Its also possible to generate a
Visual Studio solution with cmake using the examples folder as the top level
cmake folder.
